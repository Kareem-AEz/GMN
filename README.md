# Guess My Number Game ðŸŽ¯

**Guess My Number** is the first project from Jonas Schmedtmann's **["The Complete JavaScript Course"](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wfe3@WCtMdC_y1rihT29GRMBoV9qpCZMqsS4cgGOfn1Kyyw0kUv1zftIczZ-OupUhS_9i/)**. This game has been completely redesigned and reimagined with a different approach, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective is simple: guess the randomly generated number between 1 and 20. With each incorrect guess, you'll receive helpful feedback on whether your guess was too high or too low, and the score decreases with every wrong guess.

## Features ðŸŒŸ
- **Redesigned Interface**: A fresh take on the original project, with an updated design and approach.
- **Random Number Generation**: A new random number between 1 and 20 is generated for every game session.
- **Score Tracking**: Each player starts with a score of 20, which decreases with every wrong guess.
- **High Score**: The game keeps track of the highest score across multiple sessions.
- **User Feedback**: Real-time feedback helps players adjust their guesses.
- **Interactive UI**: Animated error shake effects and a smooth user interface enhance gameplay.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and works seamlessly across different screen sizes.

## How to Play ðŸŽ®
1. Enter a number between 1 and 20 in the input field.
